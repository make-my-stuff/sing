UI Ideas

- Notes fall down as a stream. Speed depends upon tempo and height depends upon duration.
- Notes have background (solid color, pattern or something else like neon glow)
- Degree of help. 1 -> You see notes falling down, 2 -> You see only the correct note highlighted.
- Correct/Incorrect notes have visual feedbacks depending upon degree of correctness. Visual feedback for degree of accuracy.
